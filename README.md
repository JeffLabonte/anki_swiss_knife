**STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS**

## Anki Swiss Knife

笔记 : 我在学中文。在这个文件我要尝试翻译

NOTE : I am learning Chinese. I will (want) try to translate this document.

### Description/描写

This project is currently only grabbing a document that has Chinese characters plus translations that I share with my teacher.

The structure of the document is the following:

你好 Nǐ hǎo Hi
...

I take those translations and make it into a CSV file. I added the option to add text-to-speech to help me remember the words and memorise the pronounciation. It was based on some code created by @marcaube.

### Setup

You need to have access to Google Cloud. You must create a service account and give access to your document using the service account email
